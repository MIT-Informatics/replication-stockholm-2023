This  replication report was created by Micah Altman, Hans Gaebler, and Georgy Tarasenko as part of an intensive single-day replication effort as part of the 'Replication Games' a multi-analyst research initiative of the Institute for Replication.


The analysis was based on pre-selection of a study from a short list of candidates provided by the organizers, and applied the provided template and nomenclature.
The protocol for the overall initiative was pre-registered by the principle investigators of the effort. (See <https://osf.io/3dseb>
Analysts were asked to 1-2 weeks in advance read the article to be replicated and develop a plan for replication day; conduct a 1-day (8-hour) intensive replication of the article; and submit a brief report based on a template provided by the organizer.

This work is not intended for stand-alone distribution or interpretablity. It is intended primarily as input to an aggregated analysis of replications for dissemination in a  multi-authored meta-paper combining a large number of replications. 
Secondarily, it is intended for inclusion  along with reports from the other replicated studies as an appendix,
supplementary information (SI/SM), or replication dataset accompanying the main meta-paper.
